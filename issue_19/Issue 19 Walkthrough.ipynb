    "## Elliot Frank\n",
    "Issue #19 in https://github.com/jasonasher/dc_doh_hackathon/issues requires that we know which inspections resulted in a closure. It seems that this isn't a field that's accessible in the summary data, so instead we're attempting to estimate if a given inspection resulted in a closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to first do two estimates. First, we'll use the number of restorations as a proxy for the number of closures, because generally a restoration immediately follows a closure. Second, we'll look at each inspection to see if the word \"closure\" appears in the inspector's comments."

    "\n",
    "However, when we read the comments, we notice that occasionally the inspector uses the term \"summary suspension\" within the course of saying that, for example, \"a summary suspension has been lifted\" – which might throw off our count.\n",

    "Now, to improve our estimate, we're going to try to integrate the two methods: first we'll do this in a basic way, by seeing how many addresses they have in common. Addresses aren't a perfect way to find distinct restaurants (for example, many restaurants point to a single address in L'Enfant plaza) but they're the best thing at the moment."

    "As we've seen, it's challenging to try to determine if a given inspection resulted in a closure. One idea is to find pairs of inspections on the same restaurant within a few weeks of each other. Generally, if an inspector closes a restaurant they will return in about a week to determine if the restaurant has complied with their recommendations and can be reopened. Roughly, we think the inspections in \"suspensions\" would correspond to the shutting-down inspection, and \"restorations\" would correspond to the re-opening inspection. \n",
